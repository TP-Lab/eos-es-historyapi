# EOS ESHistoryAPI - GO (beta)
EOS History API for Elasticsearch cluster on GO.
  
In the benchmark testing, real query traffic was redirected to this application.  
The application works stably at 300 simultaneous connections.  

## Installation
#### Get source code
```sh
$ cd $GOPATH/src
$ git clone https://github.com/atticlab/eos-es-historyapi.git
$ cd eos-es-historyapi/
```
#### 
#### Create config.json
In project directory create file config.json.  
"port" property is for the port on which server will listen.  
"elastic_url" property is for the url of elasticsearch cluster.  
"seed_node" property is for the url of node with chain_api_plugin enabled.  
For example:

    {
        "port": 9000,
        "elastic_url": "http://127.0.0.1:9201",
        "seed_node": "https://proxy.eosnode.tools"
    }  
  
The "seed_node" parameter is needed by the application to connect to the node and receive transactions.trx that are not in Elasticsearch data.  

#### Create .env file
In project directory create file .env  
Change path to GO directory to your path  
For example:
```
GOPATH=/home/eosuser/go  
NAMEREPO=eos-es-historyapi  
MIDDLEWARE_SOURCE_PORT=9000  
MIDDLEWARE_DEST_PORT=9000  
```
